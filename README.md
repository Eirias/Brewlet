The missing menulet for [brew.sh].

This menulet makes it easier to use [brew.sh]. For example, you need to
manually check if some of your packages can be updated. With Brewlet it's easy:
if everything is working swimmingly, then you'll see the normal shadow 
<img src="images/brewlet-black.svg" width="16px" /> 
icon. If updates are available to be installed, the icon will become colored,
<img src="images/brewlet-color.svg" width="16px" /> , to get your attention â€“
along with a notification if you wish.
Once clicked, you'll be able to upgrade your packages, among other options.
In addition, Brewlet will periodically check the status of packages in the
background, so you don't have to.

When new versions are available, you can update all of them at once or manually
choose specific packages:

## Installation

Download the latest version from 
[releases](https://github.com/zkokaja/Brewlet/releases/latest)
or direct link
[here (zip)](https://github.com/zkokaja/Brewlet/releases/latest/download/Brewlet.zip).

## On the horizon

I am currently working on adding more features, listed in order of priority
here:

- Ability to handle casks
- Add preferences window for time intervals
- Ability to install brew if not found
- Look for missing packages

## Update vs Upgrade

The `update` operation pulls the latest version of Homebrew and updates 
the metadata related to packages. From the `man` pages:

> Fetch the newest version of Homebrew and all formulae from GitHub using git(1) and perform any necessary migrations.

Whereas `upgrade` will actually upgrade your outdated packages to the latest
version(s).

> Upgrade  outdated,  unpinned formulae using the same options they were originally installed with, plus any appended brew formula options.

## Developer

Contributions are welcome!

You can look for logged messages and errors with the Console app, or this command
(replacing with your PID of course):

```bash
$ log show --predicate 'processID == 6259' --info
```

To test for outdated packages, reinstall some older versions from a specific
commit. For example:

```bash
$ brew uninstall jq 
$ brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/b76347c21bbe20accf0a514b138515e30a48ad12/Formula/jq.rb
```

To generate images of different sizes, use [Inkscape] on the command line:

```bash
$ len=64 # or use a for loop
$ inkscape --export-type="png" \
           --export-file brewlet-"$len".png \
           -w "$len" \
           brewlet.svg
```

## License & Acknowledgements

Because this app is closely tied to `brew.sh`, I used their icon as a template.
I also decided to adopt their choice of license: BSD 2-Clause "Simplified" License.

## Security & Permissions

Brewlet needs to be able to access to:

- the `brew.sh` shell script to get information and take action on your behalf.
- access to write to your Downloads folder when exporting a list of packages.
- permissions to send you notifications when updates are available, and when unexpected errors occur.
